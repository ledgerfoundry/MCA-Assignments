Q.3 getchar() and gets()
-> getchar(): The C library function int getchar(void) gets a character (an unsigned char) from stdin.
			This is equivalent to getc with stdin as its arguement.

	Declaration:
		Following is the declaration for getchar() function.
			- int getchar(void)

	Returns:
		This function returns the character read as an unsigned char cast to an int or EOF or error.

	
	Example:
		The following example shows the usage of getchar() function.
			#include <stdio.h>
			int main () {
				char c;
				
				printf("Enter character: ");
				c = getchar();
				
				printf("Character entered: ");
				putchar(c);
				
				return(0);
			}
			
	gets(): The C library function char *gets(char *str) reads a line from stdin and stores it into the string pointed to by str.
			It stops when either the newline character is read or when the end-of-file is reached, whichever comes first.
			
	Declaration:
		Following is the declaration for gets() function.
			- char *gets(char *str)
			
	Parameters:
		str − This is the pointer to an array of chars where the C string is stored.
		
	Returns:	
	This function returns str on success, and NULL on error or when end of file occurs, while no characters have been read.
	
	Example:
		The following example shows the usage of gets() function.
			#include <stdio.h>
			int main () {
				char str[50];
				
				printf("Enter a string : ");
				gets(str);
				
				printf("You entered: %s", str);
				
				return(0);
			}
